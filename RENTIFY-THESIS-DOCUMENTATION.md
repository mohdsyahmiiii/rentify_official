# RENTIFY PROJECT - SIMPLE THESIS DOCUMENTATION

## WHAT IS RENTIFY?
Rentify is a peer-to-peer rental marketplace website where people can rent items to each other (like Airbnb but for any item).

## THE PROBLEM I SOLVED
- Traditional rental shops charge high fees (20-30%)
- No easy way for people to rent items from each other
- No secure payment system for peer-to-peer rentals
- Poor user experience with old websites

## MY SOLUTION
I built a modern website where:
- People can list items for rent (cameras, tools, etc.)
- Others can browse and book these items
- Secure payment through Stripe (Malaysian Ringgit)
- Real-time messaging between users
- Dashboard to manage rentals

## TARGET USERS

- Rent items instead of buying them
- Make money by renting out their items

## TECHNOLOGY USED

**Backend**: Supabase (database + authentication)
**Payments**: Stripe (supports Malaysian Ringgit)

## PROBLEMS I SOLVED DURING DEVELOPMENT

**Solution**: Added timeout protection and better error handling
**Result**: No more endless loading issues

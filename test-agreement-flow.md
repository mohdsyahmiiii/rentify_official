## âœ… Implementation Complete

### Changes Made:

1. **Auto-generate agreement in background** âœ…
   - Modified `handleCreateRental` in checkout page
   - Added `generateAgreementInBackground` function
   - Agreement starts generating when rental is created

2. **Simple checkbox interface** âœ…
   - Replaced manual generate button with checkbox
   - Added modal to view agreement
   - Improved UX with loading states

3. **Database signature handling** âœ…

   - Handles both renter and owner signatures

### Test Scenarios:

2. Agreement is ready (green checkmark)
3. User clicks "View AI-generated agreement"
4. **Expected**: Modal opens with full agreement text
5. User can download agreement
6. User can close modal and continue

#### Scenario 3: Agreement Still Loading
1. User reaches agreement step quickly
2. Agreement still generating
3. **Expected**: Shows "Generating personalized agreement..." with spinner
